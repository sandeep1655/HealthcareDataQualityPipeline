# great_expectations/checkpoints/health_data_checkpoint.py
# This file is a placeholder. The checkpoint `health_data_checkpoint` is defined
# directly in `great_expectations.yml` for simplicity in this serverless context.
# Great Expectations will use the configuration from `great_expectations.yml`
# to find and run this checkpoint.
